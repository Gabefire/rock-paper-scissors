# Rock Paper Scissors Game in JavaScript
This is a simple implementation of the classic game "Rock Paper Scissors" using JavaScript. The game can be played against the computer, and the player's score is kept track of.

## Getting Started
To get started, you can either download the project files or clone the repository using the following command:

`git clone https://github.com/Gabefire/rock-paper-scissors.git`

Once you have the files, open the index.html file in your browser to start playing the game.

## How to Play
To play the game, simply click on one of the three buttons: "Rock", "Paper", or "Scissors". The computer will then randomly choose one of the three options as well. The winner is determined according to the following rules:

Rock beats Scissors
Scissors beats Paper
Paper beats Rock
If both the player and the computer choose the same option, it's a tie and no one wins.

The game is played for a total of 5 rounds, and the player's score is kept track of throughout the game. After 5 rounds, the final score is displayed.

## Technologies Used
This project was written using JavaScript, and HTML

## Future Improvements
Here are some potential improvements that could be made to the game in the future:

* Add a "Reset" button to allow the player to start a new game without having to refresh the page.
* Add a user interface to make it more visually appealing.
* Allow the player to choose how many rounds they want to play.
